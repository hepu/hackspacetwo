# Hackspace Two

## Description

A React project displaying how to tackle a design with a React way of thinking. We used the Showapp test project that fetches from TheMovieDB API.

The recommended steps are:
- Divide the design by components or sections
- Take note of the relationships between those components to identify how they communicate and how they group
- Start programming the components from the one with highest hierachy to the lowest
